# Skills needed to be a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Specialist

## Installation
This code runs with Python version 3 and requires some libraries (numpy and pandas). 

## Project Motivation
As an data science enthusiast, I wanted to know what was needed to be a Data Scientist. In this project, I used the dataset set provided by Stack Overflow's survey data from 2019. More specifically, I analyzed what makes a data scientist/machines learning specialist:
  1. Programming Language
  2. Platform
  3. Web Frame
  4. Database

## File Description
DS_MLS_Stack_Overflow.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.  
survey_results_public.csv: Stackoverflow's 2019 Annual Developer Survey data.  
survey_results_schema.csv: Details for survey results column names. 

## Results
Findings can be found on the word document

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledge
